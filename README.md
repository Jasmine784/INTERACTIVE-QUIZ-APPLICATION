DESCRIPTION: 
➤ Objective:
Develop a dynamic quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that enables users to answer questions, receive instant feedback, and track their scores.

➤ Key Features:
1.	Dynamic Question Loading:
	Questions are presented one at a time, with options displayed as clickable buttons.
	Upon selection, users receive immediate feedback indicating whether their answer was correct or incorrect.
2.	Scoring System:
	The application maintains a score counter that increments with each correct answer.
	At the end of the quiz, the user's total score is displayed.
3.	Timer:
	A countdown timer is implemented, limiting the time available to answer each question.
	If the timer reaches zero, the quiz ends automatically.
4.	Restart Functionality:
	After completing the quiz, users have the option to restart and attempt the quiz again.

➤ Project Structure:
•	index.html: Contains the structure of the quiz interface, including placeholders for questions, options, score, and timer.
•	styles.css: Provides styling to ensure the quiz interface is visually appealing and user-friendly.
•	script.js: Houses the JavaScript logic for:
	Managing the question flow.
	Handling user interactions.
	Updating the score and timer.
	Displaying results and enabling quiz restart.

➤ The Role of HTML: Structuring the Application
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the skeleton of any web application. In the context of the quiz app, HTML defines the structure and layout of the content. Key elements include:
•	<div> Containers: Used to group related content, such as the question section and result display.
•	<p> and <span> Tags: Display the current question and score.
•	<button> Elements: Allow users to select their answers.
•	<script> Tag: Links the external JavaScript file that adds interactivity.
Without HTML, the application would lack a defined structure, rendering it non-functional.

➤ The Role of CSS: Enhancing Visual Appeal
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the visual presentation of the application. It transforms the basic HTML structure into an aesthetically pleasing interface. In the quiz app, CSS is utilized to:
•	Layout Management: Employing Flexbox and Grid to arrange elements responsively.
•	Styling Elements: Defining colors, fonts, and spacing to create an inviting user interface.
•	Interactive States: Implementing hover effects and transitions to enhance user engagement.
•	Responsive Design: Ensuring the application is usable across various devices and screen sizes.
CSS not only improves the visual appeal but also contributes to the overall user experience by making the application intuitive and easy to navigate.

➤ The Role of JavaScript: Adding Interactivity
JavaScript is the dynamic engine that powers the interactivity of the quiz application. It enables the application to respond to user inputs and perform actions in real-time. Key functionalities include:
•	Question Navigation: Displaying questions sequentially and updating the interface accordingly.
•	Answer Validation: Checking user responses and providing immediate feedback.
•	Score Calculation: Tracking correct answers and updating the score dynamically.
•	Timer Management: Implementing a countdown timer for each question.
•	Quiz Restart: Allowing users to restart the quiz without reloading the page.
JavaScript's ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) enables real-time updates, creating a responsive and interactive user experience.

➤ Conclusion:

In summary, the development of this interactive quiz application has provided valuable insights into the integral roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in web development. HTML laid the structural foundation, CSS enhanced the visual presentation, and JavaScript introduced interactivity, collectively ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience. This project not only reinforced my understanding of these core technologies but also highlighted their interdependence in creating dynamic web applications.
